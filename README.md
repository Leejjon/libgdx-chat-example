libgdx-chat-example
===================

A small chat application that demonstrates my client/server architecture with libgdx. Build with maven.

In this project I am using a lot of other open source projects. Check them out for more documentation and examples:
- Libgdx (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx)
- This project is based on the template I created earlier (https://github.com/Leejjon/libgdx0.9.9-maven-example), and I wrote some wiki pages about how to set it up in Eclipse etc.
- Gwt-dispatch (http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dispatch)
- Http-dispatch (http://code.google.com/p/http-dispatch)

Some parts of the code such as the UI and the way ChatMessages are being stored both on the client and server are really ugly as I didn't spend much time on them.
